 🖋️ File Modifier

A simple Python program that **reads a file**, handles errors if the file does not exist or cannot be read, and then writes a **modified version** of the file to a new file.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Reads text from a file specified by the user.
- Handles errors gracefully:
  - File not found
  - Permission denied
  - Other unexpected errors
- Creates a new file with the prefix `modified_` and saves the modified content (in **UPPERCASE**).
